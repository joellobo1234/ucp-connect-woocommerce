### What's New vs v1.3.5
- **Fix: Order Creation**: Resolved critical issue where `complete_checkout` failed due to missing billing address. The system now automatically copies shipping address to billing when creating orders.
- **Improved UX: Payment Link Visibility**: The agent now displays the payment link in chat for 2 seconds before redirecting, allowing users to copy the link if needed.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added proper validation and error messages for WooCommerce order creation failures.

### Installation
