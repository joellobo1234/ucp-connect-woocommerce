### What's New vs v1.3.3
- **Smart Product Context**: The AI now "sees" product dimensions, attributes (care info, color), and sale status/regular price in the `search_products` output. This specifically enables scenarios like "Find a plant that fits my 10cm shelf."
- **Rich Comparisons**: Agents can now compare products side-by-side based on exposed metadata (e.g. "Which cactus is smaller?").
- **Bug Fix**: Fixed an issue where the AI only saw product names and prices, ignoring other vital decision-making data.
